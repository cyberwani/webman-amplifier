# How to translate the plugin?

Best way is to translate the plugin at its [WordPress.org repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webman-amplifier/). Just click the "[Translate WebMan Amplifier into your language](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/webman-amplifier)" link in "_Contributors & Developers_" section down on that page. This way you are helping others to use the plugin in your language and also contributing to open-source WordPress comunity. Thank you for that! :)

Alternatively, if you want to keep the translation for yourself ;), you can use a [Loco Translate plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) to translate any plugin (and theme) directly in your WordPress dashboard.

## WARNING! Do not place your translation files here.

Any translation files placed here (into the `webman-amplifier/languages` folder) will be deleted when you update the plugin, sorry. This is really not the correct way to translate a WordPress plugin any more.
